### About me

Originally from Seoul, South Korea, I am a graduate student and part-time instructor at University of Colorado Boulder, former speech and debate coach, volunteer software engineer, and an accessibility advocate. My interests are operating systems, Python, assistive technologies, screen readers, communicative dimensions of software source code, and organizational communication.

### What I do

* Nonvisual Desktop Access: I have been a part of this screen reader project since 2012, starting out as a translator then moving onto publishing add-ons and pull requests. Some of the highlights of my work include wxPython Phoenix (version 4) research, Python 2 to 3 transition, ongoing work on Windows 10 and 11 support, and launching NVDA Users and Developers Conference (NVDACon) in 2014.
* College teaching: currently I serve as an instructor of record at CU Boulder. Prior to this, I coached competitive speech and debate to college students.
* Research: as a PhD student at CU Boulder, I research the relationship between organizations, technology, and disability, specifically the communicative dimensions of software source code and its development. My research interests are new and emerging information and communication technologies (ICT's) in professional contexts, software development and organizational communication, technology design and abelism communicated through source code, and disability-focused communication studies pedagogy.
* Windows Insider: I have been part of Windows Insider Program since 2014 and have been testing preview releases of Windows operating systems, with an emphasis on providing feedback that centers accessibility of various features for people with disabilities.
