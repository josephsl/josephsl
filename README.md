### About me

Originally from Seoul, South Korea, I am a graduate student, speech and debate coach, volunteer software engineer, and an accessibility advocate. My interests are operating systems, Python, assistive technologies, screen readers, software source code as rhetoric, and organizational communication.

### What I do

* Nonvisual Desktop Access: I have been a part of this screen reader project since 2012, starting out as a translator then moving onto publishing add-ons and pull requests. Some of the highlights of my work include wxPython Phoenix (version 4) research, Python 2 to 3 transition, ongoing work on Windows 10 and 11 support, and launching NVDA Users and Developers Conference (NVDACon) in 2014.
* Speech and debate coaching: I teach competitive speech and debate to college students.
